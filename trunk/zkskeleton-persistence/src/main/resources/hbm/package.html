This package contain the Hibernate mappings. <br>
<br>

When you add a mapping here, also add it to zkskeleton-persistence-context.xml.
This needs to be addressed at a later stage to pick up the files automatically. The reason for not using a mappingDirectoryLocation 
pointing to this package is that the JAR does not contain directory entries, so it throws FileNotFoundException.
